# BadgeBrigade

Welcome to BadgeBrigade ðŸ‘‹

Where tech employers and Eleven Fifty grads meet! We are proud of the skills we've gained as students at Eleven Fifty and are eager to connect with employers. This was the inspiration for Badge Brigade - students can post their skills, job status and link to their portfolio while employers can post job listings and view students.

To build this, we used Angular, Angular Material, Bootstrap and Node.js with Express, the Google Maps API and the GitHub jobs API. 


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
